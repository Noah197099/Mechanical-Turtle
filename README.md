# Mechanical-Turtle
School Project #1

This is a very basic menu-driven program. By maneuvering through the menu, you are able to move a "Turtle", represented by a character, across a two-dimensional grid. The turtle can leave behind a trail allowing you to "draw" on the grid. A very simple game that is fun for a few minutes.
